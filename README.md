# Task 1
The goal of this project is to develop a simple calculator application using Java that operates through the command-line interface. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Tools Used:

Programming Language: Java (JDK 8 or higher)

IDE: Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ Community Edition

Execution: Terminal / Command Prompt


Key Features:

Uses methods for each arithmetic operation to promote code reusability.

Employs Scanner class to capture user input from the console.

Includes a loop mechanism to allow continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Handles division by zero gracefully with a proper error message.
